# Basic-Fund-me Smart Contract

Welcome to FundMe, my first blockchain project! This project is a simple implementation of a crowdfunding smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to contribute funds (in Ether) to a pool and withdraw them later.

## Overview

FundMe consists of two main contracts:

1. **FundMe.sol**: This contract manages the crowdfunding functionality. Users can contribute funds, and the contract owner can withdraw them.

2. **PriceConverter.sol**: A library contract used internally by FundMe to convert Ether to USD using Chainlink's Price Feed.

## Development Environment

The contracts were developed using Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Remix provides a convenient environment for writing, deploying, and testing smart contracts directly in your browser.

## About

This project is a learning exercise aimed at understanding smart contract development on the Ethereum blockchain. It utilizes Solidity for writing smart contracts and Remix for development.
